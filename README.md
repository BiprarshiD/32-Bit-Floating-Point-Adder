# 32-Bit-Floating-Point-Adder
Design a floating point adder that takes two 32 bit single precision floating point input values that come serially with a time difference of 8 clock cycles between two inputs and stores the resultant value into eight RAMs. Perform the addition operation for 8 sets of input values
